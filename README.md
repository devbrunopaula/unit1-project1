# User Interface Project 1

## Step 1: Fork this pen so it's yours.

## Step 2: Practice marking up this content using semantic HTML tags.

Remember that semantic markup provides meaning. Here are a few tags you could consider using:

[x] _ <h1> through <h6>
[x] _ <p>
[x] _ <header>
[x] _ <footer>
[x] _ <nav>
[x] _ <a>
[x] _ <section>
[x] _ <address>

Don't worry about CSS here, The goal is to markup the page in a semantic way.

Step 3: Once you're done marking the content up. Let your project manager know and send them a link to your codepen.
