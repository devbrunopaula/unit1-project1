# User Interface Project 1

=============

## Step 1: Fork this pen so it's yours.

## Step 2: Practice marking up this content using semantic HTML tags.

Remember that semantic markup provides meaning. Here are a few tags you could consider using:

- [x] <h1> through <h6>
- [x] <p>
- [x] <header>
- [x] <footer>
- [x] <nav>
- [x] <a>
- [x] <section>
- [x] <address>

Don't worry about CSS here, The goal is to markup the page in a semantic way.

Step 3: Once you're done marking the content up. Let your project manager know and send them a link to your codepen.
